# STAR COMMAND NES
this is a ~~very bad~~ attempt at porting [star command](https://squeakyfoxx.itch.io/star-command) to the NES. some NES experts will be able to see that the code really isn't very good at all, but I tried my best.

# BUILDING THE GAME:
requires:<br>
asm6<br>
an NES emulator of your choice, or a flash cart.<br>

instructions:<br>
once asm6 is installed and on path, either use the makefile, or type in the terminal `asm6 main.asm star-command.nes`. this should output an NES rom usable in an emulator or flash cart.<br>
DO NOT USE THE MAKEFILE.<br>
the makefile was intended to be a quick way to build the game for myself, and is in no way complete enough to use. it's literally just the assembler commands above, and opens the rom in fceux. 

# Mentions
I should mention a couple people here, mainly: <br>
